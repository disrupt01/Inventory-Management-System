# Inventory-Management-System
This software doesn't work as expected. It is my college project.
Help is needed for its proper functioning.
Run ivms.py.
You first need to login.
Use user-id: Shivam.
Use password: ascaban.
Make sure all the three files- ivms.py, widget_file.py and create_tool_tip are in the same folder.

It has 3 tabs-
1. Data Entry: To enter product details and then store the entered data in a txt file and display them on spreadsheet tab.
2. Search: To find details about a product through its product id
3. Spread Sheet: To display all the details of the products in the warehouse in a tabular manner.

PROBLEMS
I have used OOP in this but I think I have not used OOP very well.
How can I improve the OOP in this.

Search doesn't work. 
The entry widgets in 'Search' don't display the default values stored in 'strx' list.
When you click the 'Search' button they should display the values set to the variables through the 'stry' list.
I have not integrated a serching program into it which searches on the basis of Product ID entered.

I need to integrate a spreadsheet into this software.
The spreadsheet will display all the details of the products in the warehouse in a tabular manner.
I don't know how to integrate the spreadsheet.

I also want to make an exe file of the project.
I tried cx_Freeze and other methods but the exe file does'nt work properly.
